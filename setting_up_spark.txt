create a new directory if you want and mkdir

or go ahead and run this in your terminal

wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/spark/spark-3.4.0/spark-3.4.0-bin-hadoop3.tgz

then install it

tar -xvf spark-3.4.0-bin-hadoop3.tgz

Make sure you allow the ports to be opened! You can run:

sudo apt install net-tools

netstat -na | grep 2181

in a new terminal, navigate to the Spark directory and start the Spark server:

sbin/start-all.sh
