### The Business is doing a high profile survey to find a suitable area to safe guard the Board of Directors in an event of a global war break out. Some geographical information is required. The Business needs to know the following:
-------

### 1. How many airports, airfields and heliports exist in each country and continent?
### 2. What is the average elevation of the airports, airfields and heliports in each country?
### 3. What is the estimated population of each country?
### 4. How many cities/towns/settlements in each country?
### 5. What is the min, max and average elevation of the cities per country?
### 6. Which are the highest and lowest elevated cities in the world with populations > 100000?
### 7. Which are the highest and lowest elevated airports, airfields and heliports on the planet?
